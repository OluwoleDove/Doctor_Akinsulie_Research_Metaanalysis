RESEARCH OVERVIEW
This research work aims to compare the causes, interventions, and vaccination strategies for cholera and COVID-19 across different regions. It utilizes statistical methods like mean, standard deviation, and Cohen's d to analyze the data and generate informative visualizations such as heatmaps, bar plots, and forest plots.

USAGE
The project's code is structured to guide you through the analysis process, from data preprocessing to statistical analysis and visualization generation. Each step is accompanied by explanatory comments for clarity.

DATA
The data used for this analysis has been preprocessed into a Pandas DataFrame.

RESULTS
The analysis results are presented in the form of visualizations and statistical summaries, providing insights into the similarities and differences between cholera and COVID-19 in terms of causes, interventions, and vaccination strategies across different regions.

CCNCLUSION
This meta-analysis sheds light on the global patterns of cholera and COVID-19 based on standard academic research and critical analysis, highlighting the effectiveness of interventions and vaccination strategies in combating these diseases. The findings can inform public health policies and guide future research directions.
